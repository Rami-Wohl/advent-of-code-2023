# 2023 Advent of Code solutions

This repo contains my solutions for the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. This year is my first time participating. As a nice additional challenge I decided to try to solve the challenges with Rust, which I have close to zero proficiency in. Some answers are later refactored based on published solutions by others, but the folders for most days will still contain whatever I first came up with myself.
